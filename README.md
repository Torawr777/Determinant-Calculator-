The goal of this project is to compute determinants of matrices.
Why? Determinants are useful for many things:
* determining how much a matrix stretches space. This is useful in 3D graphics.
* inverting a matrix, which is important for... 
* ...solving a system of equations using Cramer's rule. 
* learning whether our matrix will invert the orientation of the coordinate system (left-handed to right-handed and vice versa).
